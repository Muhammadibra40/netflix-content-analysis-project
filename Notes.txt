First thing to check 
--------------------

So, the cells data look very lengthy so we need to check of the maximum length of each column to determine the length for the columns which are VARCHAR

=MAX(LEN(column_head:column_head))

EX:

=MAX(LEN(A:A))


Title_Column	104
director	208
cast		771
country		123
date_added	19
release_year	8
rating		104
duration	10
listed_in	79
description	250


Second thing to check 
---------------------
We wanna know if there are null values in each column just follow the following:

1- CTRL + a --> to select all the cells.
2- Go to filter tab.
3- then, each column header will be with a list of all the distinct values in the column.
4- Scroll down to see if there is a blank value.
